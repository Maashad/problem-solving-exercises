# Problem Solving Exercises 
Practice skills related to thinking about problems through a technical lens, to include:  
* Communicating and displaying thought processes prior to coding
* Considering requirements 
* Asking questions of myself that may provide clarity about design
* Writing basic unit tests to ensure understanding of input vs output and/or requisite changes to mutable objects  

## Format 
---  

The format of each PSE (problem solving exercise) will include: 
1. Problem statement describing requirements
2. My clarifying questions
3. Breaking down the problem into small chunks to reason through (unit tests; can be found in the `tests` directory).  


## **PSE 1**  

Create a function named `get_highest_rated` that is responsible for finding the highest rated restaurant.  

The function should take in a list of dictionaries named `restaurants` as a parameter. Each dictionary represents the data associated with a restaurant, including its rating. This function should have a return value of the restaurant with the highest rating.  

*Clarifying questions*  

1. What if there are multiple restaurants tied for the highest rating?
2. How should the function handle dictionaries with missing data (i.e., name or rating)?
3. Does function behavior change if there are additional keys other than **"name"** and **"rating"**?
4. Function behavior when non-numerical values for **"rating"** are input?
5. Function behavior when input is a single dictionary instead of a list?
